# Failed Experiments / Archive

This directory contains exploratory and abandoned code used during early
research and prototyping of the Theta Toolkit. Nothing here is maintained
or supported.

Do NOT use any file in this directory in production environments.

These files may include:
- early Python toolkit attempts
- toy obfuscation and crypto-like experiments (NOT secure)
- deprecated ray visualization code
- early CUDA kernels (prime scanning, theta-order analysis)
- ML experiments (vectorized transforms, Numba prototypes)

All official, supported code lives in:
  - cuda/theta_cuda_v1.2.cuh
  - cuda/theta_cuda_benchmark_v1.2.cu
  - cuda/THETA_SPEC_v1.2.md
